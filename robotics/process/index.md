Example Process for Subsystem Design of a Drivetrain

## 1. Define the Problem
   - Questions
      - What is the problem?
      - Why is it a problem?
   - Actions
      - Our existing differential tank drivetrain does not survive the rigors of multiple competition events
      - Instead of spending time improving other portions of the robot, we instead spend too much time making sure the drivetrain is 100% working
   - Outcome
      - We need a robust, reliable, yet easily servicable differential tank drive train

## 2. Research Requirements and Constraints
   - Questions:
      - How have others solved similar problems?
         - Consider designs, parts, etc.
       - What external and internal restrictions are there?
         - Rulebook, cost, manufacturability, etc.
   - Actions
      - From looking at multiple successful teams' robots and discussions on CD ([1](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=152211), [2](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=94288), [3](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=124538), we noticed most teams use aluminum box tubing, cantilever all wheels, direct drive one wheel, some form of tensioning.
      - We also found teams vary with selections of gearboxes/transmissions (gear reduction, number of motors, shifting), wheels (sizes and types), belts vs chains.
      - From the rulebook, we are restricted on components, size, weight and power.
      - From a cost standpoint, the more we make in house the cheaper the total cost, *generally*.
         - It is also easier to cut plastics then metal, and machining thinner aluminum is far easier than machining a block of aluminum.
   - Outcome
      - Recommended Requirements:
         - Easily servicable wheels, chain/belts, transmissions
         - Robust and Reliable to last more than a competition season
         - Cantilevered Wheels
         - Manufacture in house where possible
         - Use Center to Center calculators for [Belts](http://www.wcproducts.net/how-to-belts/), [Chains](http://www.botlanta.org/converters/dale-calc/sprocket.html), and [Gears](http://www.wcproducts.net/how-to-gears/) to ensure proper spacing and prevent wear
         - Use Gearbox Calculators to determine gear ratios and desired FPS - [WCProducts](http://www.wcproducts.net/how-to-drivetrain/) and [JVN Design Calculator](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AprigkKMKYgtgalQQPmc59XpZ3NQuQ)
         - Support for various wheel setups (omni/traction, 6 vs 8, etc) and various transmissions (2 vs 3 CIM, etc)

## 3. Develop Concepts

## 4. Prototype Concepts

## 5. Decision Analysis

## 6. Refine Design

## 7. Implement Final Design

## 8. Test and Analyze
