The STEM Alliance of Fargo Moorhead has been created under the Greater Fargo Moorhead Economic Development Corporation as an alliance of area companies to collectively support area STEM education and inspiration events by providing financial contributions, employee mentorships, and use of their services and facilities. These opportunities give students a great experience exploring STEM activities to inspire them towards careers in STEM-related fields. The STEM Alliance works closely with area schools like NDSU, West Fargo and Fargo Public Schools and Moorhead Public Schools to attract kids to these STEM activities and to host events. 

The STEM Alliance of Fargo Moorhead is a project supported by the [Greater Fargo Moorhead Economic Development Corporation](http://www.gfmedc.com/) and [Education That Works](http://educationthatworksndmn.org/). The GFMEDC supports education initiatives that align workforce with industry needs and creates opportunities for both children and educators to create an optimal learning environment. Education that Works is a collaborative effort among the GFMEDC, [United Way of Cass-Clay](http://www.unitedwaycassclay.org/), and the [Fargo](https://www.fargo.k12.nd.us/), [Moorhead](https://www.moorheadschools.org/) and [West Fargo](https://www.west-fargo.k12.nd.us/) Public School Districts.
